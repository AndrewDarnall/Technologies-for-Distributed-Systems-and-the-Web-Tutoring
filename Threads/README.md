# Java Threads Examples

The examples in this directory are well documented and fully functioning

- The MultiTasker.java example covers a basic example of how to use and implement Threads in Java using both the Runnable interface and Threads class

- The SharingIsCaring.java example covers the manipulation of a shared object (shared among the threads), that isn't part of the Threads class or Runnable interface but rather an externally processed object which must reside within a <b>synchronized</b> block of code.

- Solution Itinere 2023, contains the solution to the 'Prova in itinere' on Threads from the previous academic year
